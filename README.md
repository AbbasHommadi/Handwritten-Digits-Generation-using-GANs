# Handwritten-Digits-Generation-using-GANs
## 
## Project Summary
This project aims to develop a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic handwritten digit images, mimicking human-like handwriting styles. The GAN model will be trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of thousands of handwritten digit samples (0-9). The generator network will learn to create realistic digit images, while the discriminator will distinguish between real and generated digits.The generated images can be used for data augmentation, enhancing OCR systems, or artistic purposes.

## Output example
Here is an example of the handwritten digit generated by the model:

## Framework
Pytorch
